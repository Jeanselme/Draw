# Draw
Tools and simple tests on quick-draw dataset

## Download
For now, I have not find an easy way to locally download the whole dataset. So copy the .njson files which interest you in 'data/' directory.

## Display
The script display.py takes for argument the name of the file and save the associated images in 'image/' directory. If no file is specified, it takes all the files in 'data/'.  
The result is an image where the color goes from light blue (first line) to dark one (end of draw). - OPTION NON AVALAIBLE (absence of time in data)  
Other options are available : '-h' for displaying them.

## Dependencies
Executed with python3.5 with matplotlib library
